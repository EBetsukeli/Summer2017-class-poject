					<h1>AQUARIUS</h1>
		
						<p>Thanks to its position in the zodiac, not to mention a hit Broadway song, Aquarius, the water bearer, is one of the most famous constellations. But few people have actually seen it because it's so faint. It is home to the summer Delta Aquarid meteor shower, which like the constellation itself is fairly thin and sparse. </p>


						<p>Several of the stars of Aquarius have names that signify luck or good fortune. The most prominent examples are the constellation's two brightest stars, Sadalmelik and Sadalsuud. The names are from ancient Arabic, and mean "lucky one of the king" and "luckiest of the lucky." The names may refer to the stars' positions. When the constellations were named, the Sun passed through this region of the sky in early spring, when the long nights of winter had passed and the new season brought life-giving rains. Aquarius is one of several "watery" constellations in that part of the sky. </p>

						<p>The constellation is home to the globular cluster M2. It is 38,000 light-years from Earth, but is bright enough to see through binoculars because it consists of about 100,000 stars packed into a dense ball just a few light-years in diameter.</p>
